<h1>URL API</h1>

This is a small library for parsing URLs, which provides an actual object model
of the elements of URLs and their component objects.

Unlike <code>java.net.url</code>, URLs and all of their components can be invalid and provide human-friendly
localized messages as to what's wrong with them - no <code>MalformedURLException</code>s and nothing
that will unexpectedly make a network connection if you use it as a <code>HashMap</code> key.

URLs also do minimal self-normalizing when parsed (handling <code>..</code> in paths, replacing
"localhost" with 127.0.0.1 or ::1 - very minimal, but sufficient to de-duplicate equivalent
URLs.  A <b>lot</b> of work went into reading RFCs to get things right here, and it has
an exhaustive test-suite.  URLs can be parsed or built with builders.

<code>java.net.URL</code> was developed for HotJava in the 90s, and was probably
great for that use case - and that use case only.  This is a library for doing
modern Java coding with URLs.
